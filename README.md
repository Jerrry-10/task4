Add to the <SearchBar /> component a button that will do the following:

    on the first click, sort the movies in ASCENDING ORDER based on movie length
    on the second click, sort the movies in DESCENDING ORDER based on movie length
    subsequent clicks should alternate (e.g. 3rd ASCENDING, 4th, DESCENDING, etc.)
